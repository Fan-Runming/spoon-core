## ❓ FAQ

### Q: Do I need to create slides?
**A:** Only if the submission requires a presentation. If it's optional, prioritize the Notion page and live demo instead.

### Q: Which deployment platform should I use?
**A:** **Render.com** is recommended:
- Free tier available
- Easy setup (just connect GitHub)
- Auto-deploys on git push
- Good for Python/FastAPI

Railway is also excellent but has $5/month minimum after trial.

### Q: How long does deployment take?
**A:** 
- Setup: 5-10 minutes (account creation + config)
- First deploy: 2-3 minutes
- Subsequent deploys: 1-2 minutes (auto-triggered)

### Q: Can I edit these documents?
**A:** **YES!** These are templates. Feel free to:
- Add your personal voice
- Adjust technical details
- Include your team info
- Modify roadmap based on your vision

### Q: What if I don't have time for everything?
**A:** **Minimum viable submission (30 min):**
1. Deploy app (15 min)
2. Create Notion page (10 min)
3. Update GitHub README (5 min)

That's enough! Everything else is enhancement.

### Q: Where should I add screenshots?
**A:** Add to:
1. **Notion page** (most important)
2. **GitHub README** (nice to have)
3. **Slides** (if creating presentation)

### Q: How do I test if my links work?
**A:** Use **incognito mode** in your browser:
- Cmd + Shift + N (Mac)
- Ctrl + Shift + N (Windows)

If links work there, judges can access them!

## 🎓 Pro Tips

### 1. Start with Deployment
Get your app live FIRST. It's easier to document a working demo than to rush deployment last minute.

### 2. Test Everything Yourself
Before submitting, go through the full user journey:
- Add 3-4 test people
- Try search
- Test on mobile (DevTools or real phone)
- Check all buttons work

### 3. Use Real-ish Data
Create interesting example profiles:
- "Sarah Chen - AI Researcher from MIT"
- "David Park - DeFi Developer from Singapore"
- "Maria Garcia - UX Designer from Barcelona"

Makes demos more engaging than "John Doe - Engineer".

### 4. Keep It Simple
Don't overcomplicate. A working prototype with clear documentation beats an ambitious unfinished product.

### 5. Show, Don't Just Tell
- Screenshots > descriptions
- Demo video > text explanations
- Live demo > static images

## 🆘 If You're Stuck

### Issue: Can't deploy
→ Read `SUBMISSION_CHECKLIST.md` → "Troubleshooting" section  
→ Check Render/Railway logs for errors  
→ Verify `GEMINI_API_KEY` is set  

### Issue: Don't have Gemini API key
→ Get free key: https://ai.google.dev/  
→ Or use OpenAI instead (modify code to use `OPENAI_API_KEY`)

### Issue: Running out of time
→ Focus on: Deploy + Notion page + GitHub README  
→ Skip: Slides, video, extra polish

### Issue: Not sure what to write in Notion
→ Just copy-paste from `NOTION_PAGE_CONTENT.md`!  
→ It's already written for you  
→ Only need to add screenshots and URLs
